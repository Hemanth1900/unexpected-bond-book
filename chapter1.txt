Chapter 1
The Weight of Quiet Things

I don’t remember when things started changing inside me.

There wasn’t a specific day… no dramatic incident… no loud heartbreak.

Just a slow shift.

Like a room getting darker even though the light is still on.

People still laughed around me. Conversations still happened. Life kept moving in its usual rhythm. Nothing stopped. Nothing broke. Nothing announced that something was wrong.

But inside… something had started sitting quietly.

Watching. Thinking. Feeling more than it should.

Charan — that’s my name.

If someone asked what kind of person I am, I wouldn’t know how to answer. I’m not the loudest in the room. Not the funniest. Not the most confident. I’m just… there. Present. Listening more than speaking.

But I feel things deeply.

Too deeply sometimes.

I notice the small shifts people don’t usually see. The pause before someone replies. The change in their tone when they’re tired. The way silence grows when something is left unsaid.

And those small things stay with me longer than they should.

I learned early that not every feeling needs words. Some emotions don’t come out through conversations. They settle somewhere inside your chest and quietly become a part of you.

Most days, I act normal.

I talk normally. I smile when needed. I respond the way people expect me to.

But there’s always another version of me running in the background.

Thinking.

Replaying.

Questioning.

Was that real?

Did they mean it?

Why do I care this much?

I never told anyone this, but I’ve always felt like I exist more in my thoughts than in the world itself.

Like my body is present… but my mind is somewhere else, constantly observing, constantly trying to understand.

And maybe that’s where everything started.

Not with a person.

Not with love.

Not with pain.

Just… with me.

I used to think everyone felt this way.

That everyone overthought conversations after they ended. That everyone replayed moments before sleeping. That everyone felt heaviness without knowing why.

But slowly, I realized most people move on faster.

They laugh, forget, replace, continue.

I stay.

Not physically… but mentally.

I stay in moments. In words. In expressions people didn’t even realize they showed.

And the worst part?

I get attached to things that were never mine.

A late-night conversation.

A random act of care.

Someone remembering something small about me.

For them, it might have been normal. For me, it became something I carried for days.

Sometimes I wonder if my heart just doesn’t know how to behave casually.

It either feels everything…

or nothing at all.

There’s no in-between.

And that’s dangerous.

Because when you feel everything, even silence becomes loud.

Even distance feels like rejection.

Even a small change in someone’s tone feels like something breaking.

I never show this side though.

People know me as calm. Balanced. Easy to talk to.

They don’t see the noise inside.

They don’t see how many conversations I replay in my head.

How many endings I imagine before things even begin.

How I prepare myself to lose people… before they even decide to stay.

Maybe that’s why I never fully let go.

Or maybe… I was just waiting.

Waiting for someone who would make all this noise feel understood.

Not fixed.

Not judged.

Just… understood.

Some nights are harder than others.

Not because something happened that day…

but because nothing happened at all.

Those are the nights when my mind refuses to stay quiet.

It searches for memories. Replays old conversations. Finds faces I tried to forget… and places I never really left.

I lie there, staring at the ceiling, feeling everything at once and nothing at the same time.

It’s strange how a person can be surrounded by people all day…

and still feel completely alone when the lights go off.

That’s when the real thoughts come out.

Questions I never ask anyone.

Am I too much?

Do I care more than I should?

Why do I get attached so easily?

No one ever taught me how to feel less. How to detach. How to stop my heart from holding onto moments like they’re permanent.

And honestly… I don’t even know if I want to.

Because even though it hurts sometimes…

these feelings are the only proof that I’m alive inside.

That I still care.

That I still hope.

Hope.

That dangerous, quiet thing.

It makes you believe someone will understand you someday.

That one person will look at you… and see beyond the calm face… and notice the chaos you hide so carefully.

Not to fix it.

But to sit beside it.

To stay.

I don’t know when that person will come into my life.

Or if they already have, and I just didn’t notice.

But I know one thing for sure.

The day someone truly understands me…

without me having to explain every piece of my silence…

that day will change everything.

Because the truth is…

life doesn’t always change with loud moments.

Sometimes, it shifts quietly.

So quietly…

that by the time you notice…

you’re already a different person.
