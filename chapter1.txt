Chapter 1
The Weight of Quiet Things

I don’t remember when things started changing inside me.
There wasn’t a specific day… no dramatic incident… no loud heartbreak.

Just a slow shift.

Like a room getting darker even though the light is still on.

People still laughed around me. Conversations still happened.
But inside… something had started sitting quietly.
Watching. Thinking. Feeling more than it should.
